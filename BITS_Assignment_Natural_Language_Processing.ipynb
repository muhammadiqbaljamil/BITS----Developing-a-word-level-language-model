    "### Explanation :\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Preparing text for developing a word-level language model involves several key steps:\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Text Gathering:</b> Gather the text data that you want to use for training your model. It could be a corpus of text from novels, newspapers, web pages, etc. It is essential to choose a corpus that is representative of the type of language model you want to develop.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Text Cleaning:</b> The raw text data usually contains a lot of noise like HTML tags, emojis, special characters, etc. that are not necessary for our language model. The text needs to be cleaned by removing these unnecessary characters.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Text Normalization:</b> This involves several steps such as:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Lowercasing:</b> To ensure that the model doesn't treat 'word' and 'Word' as two different words, it is a good idea to convert all the text into lowercase.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Lemmatization/Stemming:</b> This reduces the words to their base or root form. For instance, 'running' will be reduced to 'run'. However, whether you do this or not will depend on the specific requirements of your model.\n",
    "Removing Stop Words: Stop words like 'is', 'the', 'and' etc. occur very frequently in text data and don't contain valuable information, so they can be removed.\n",
    "Handling Punctuation: Depending on your needs, you may want to remove punctuation, or replace them with token representations.\n",
    "Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of breaking down the text into individual words or tokens. In a word-level language model, tokens are typically individual words.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Vocabulary Creation: After tokenization, a vocabulary of unique words is created. This vocabulary serves as the input feature space for the model.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Sequence Creation:</b> Language models are trained to predict the next word in a sequence. Therefore, from your tokenized text, you need to create sequences of words. The length of these sequences is a parameter that you can tune.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Encoding Sequences:</b> The sequences of words are then encoded into sequences of integers or one-hot encoded vectors. The encoding process transforms the textual information into numerical input that the language model can process.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Preparing Training and Validation Set:</b> Divide the dataset into a training set and validation set. The training set is used to train the model while the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during the training process.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Padding Sequences :</b> Depending on your model architecture, you may need to ensure that all sequences have the same length. You can do this by padding shorter sequences with a special symbol (like 'PAD').\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Preparing Labels:</b> For each sequence, the corresponding label will be the word that comes after the sequence in the text data. These labels are what the model will try to predict.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "</p>\n"
