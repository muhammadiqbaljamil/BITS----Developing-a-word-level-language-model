    "### Explanation :\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Preparing text for developing a word-level language model involves several key steps:\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Text Gathering:</b> Gather the text data that you want to use for training your model. It could be a corpus of text from novels, newspapers, web pages, etc. It is essential to choose a corpus that is representative of the type of language model you want to develop.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Text Cleaning:</b> The raw text data usually contains a lot of noise like HTML tags, emojis, special characters, etc. that are not necessary for our language model. The text needs to be cleaned by removing these unnecessary characters.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Text Normalization:</b> This involves several steps such as:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Lowercasing:</b> To ensure that the model doesn't treat 'word' and 'Word' as two different words, it is a good idea to convert all the text into lowercase.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Lemmatization/Stemming:</b> This reduces the words to their base or root form. For instance, 'running' will be reduced to 'run'. However, whether you do this or not will depend on the specific requirements of your model.\n",
    "Removing Stop Words: Stop words like 'is', 'the', 'and' etc. occur very frequently in text data and don't contain valuable information, so they can be removed.\n",
    "Handling Punctuation: Depending on your needs, you may want to remove punctuation, or replace them with token representations.\n",
    "Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of breaking down the text into individual words or tokens. In a word-level language model, tokens are typically individual words.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Vocabulary Creation: After tokenization, a vocabulary of unique words is created. This vocabulary serves as the input feature space for the model.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Sequence Creation:</b> Language models are trained to predict the next word in a sequence. Therefore, from your tokenized text, you need to create sequences of words. The length of these sequences is a parameter that you can tune.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Encoding Sequences:</b> The sequences of words are then encoded into sequences of integers or one-hot encoded vectors. The encoding process transforms the textual information into numerical input that the language model can process.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Preparing Training and Validation Set:</b> Divide the dataset into a training set and validation set. The training set is used to train the model while the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during the training process.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Padding Sequences :</b> Depending on your model architecture, you may need to ensure that all sequences have the same length. You can do this by padding shorter sequences with a special symbol (like 'PAD').\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Preparing Labels:</b> For each sequence, the corresponding label will be the word that comes after the sequence in the text data. These labels are what the model will try to predict.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "</p>\n"

      "question as to the origin of this Will--until at last we came to an\n",
      "absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired\n",
      "about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT\n",
      "RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the\n",
      "value of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presented\n",
      "ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which\n",

      "to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk\n",
      "in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth\n",
      "out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the\n",
      "generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the\n",

      "mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which\n",
      "metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation\n",
      "is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this \"belief\" of\n",
      "theirs, they exert themselves for their \"knowledge,\" for something that\n",
      "is in the end solemnly christened \"the Truth.\" The fundamental belief of\n",

      "perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from\n",

      "the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher\n",
      "and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to\n",
      "pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It\n",
      "might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and\n",
      "respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously\n",
      "related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed\n",
      "things--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps!\n",
      "But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous \"Perhapses\"!\n",

      "philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the\n",
      "reverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerous\n",
      "\"Perhaps\" in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I\n",
      "see such new philosophers beginning to appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between\n",
      "their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of\n",
      "conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and\n",
      "it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to\n",
      "learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and \"innateness.\" As\n",
      "little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process\n",
      "and procedure of heredity, just as little is \"being-conscious\" OPPOSED\n",
      "to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the\n",
      "conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his\n",
      "instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and\n",
      "its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak\n",
      "more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite\n",
      "mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the\n",
      "uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than \"truth\" such valuations,\n",
      "in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be\n",
      "only superficial valuations, special kinds of _niaiserie_, such as may\n",
      "be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing,\n",
      "in effect, that man is not just the \"measure of things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is\n",
      "here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The\n",
      "question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving,\n",
      "species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally\n",
      "inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic\n",
      "judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that\n",
      "without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of\n",
      "reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable,\n",
      "without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers,\n",
      "man could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would be\n",
      "a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A\n",
      "CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of\n",
      "value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so,\n",
      "has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully\n",
      "and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they\n",
      "are--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in\n",
      "short, how childish and childlike they are,--but that there is not\n",

      "sensation, which, even without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\"\n",
      "commences its action by force of habit, directly we \"will\" anything.\n",

      "commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other\n",

      "when the effect of the command--consequently obedience, and therefore\n",
      "action--was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into\n",
      "the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who\n",
